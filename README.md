# LoanCalculator
 A very early stage loan calculator for a specific purpose
 The displayed text is in finnish but its a fairly simple program. You input the loan amount, the interest rate for the loan, the fixed monthly payment and if there are any months where the payment is skipped but the interest is still calculated. Then the program will spit out how many months it takes to pay the loan and what the last payment will be.
